# Week 1

## What have I done this week?
- Implementation of basic data structure (Node).
- Implementation of algorithm first steps (sorting and creating node).
- Unit test coverage of non-UI/Main methods to approximately 70%.
- Added some code documentation.

## How has the program progressed?
- Nodes are now created from the character/frequency HashMap.
- Nodes are then inserted into a PriorityQueue with a reverse comparator.
- From the PriorityQueue, a binary tree is build based on the frequencies of the node.

## What have I learned this week?
- Not too much to be honest. I have refreshed my knowledge of some Java concepts
JUnit.

## What remains unclear / has brought difficulties?
- Nothing yet to report.

## What will I do next?
- Continue my implementation, the next step being to start using the HuffmanTree
to encode/decode the symbols.
