# Week 1

## What have I done this week?
- Researched the idea of Huffman coding and the principles of file compression.
- Begun my first steps of the implementation

## How has the program progressed?
- Mostly planning and thinking about structures at the moment.
- Implemented a basic class to read symbols from a file, and count and map those
symbols. Also added unit tests for this class.

## What have I learned this week?
- All about Huffman coding and the principles related to it.
- How lossless compression works in principle and why it works.

## What remains unclear / has brought difficulties?
- I am unsure about the limits of Huffman coding. Can binary files be compressed
by using it? Not as far as I can see. If so, I need to include some kind of
check that tries to detect binary files.

## What will I do next?
- I have implemented a basic reader class, so I will next try to transform the
symbols in a Huffman tree using a priority queue.
- From there, I will create a 'Writer' class.

p.s. I hope it's okay that I write everything in English!
