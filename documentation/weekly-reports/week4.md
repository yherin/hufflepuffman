# Week 4

## What have I done this week?
- Implementation of decoding text from binary.

## How has the program progressed?
- The core of the program is coming along. However, there are some significant, annoying bugs, but ones which
I didn't have time to solve before the deadline (busy week at work, bad time management).
 - The decoded text file seems to cut off at some random point, I have a feeling this
 has to do with new line characters, but I didn't yet examine it.
 - In some text there appears to be some missing whitespace (e.g. 1 in every 100 characters). I don't really get how this
 can be so, but it will need some investigating.

## What have I learned this week?
- More Java bitwise stuff and file handling.

## What remains unclear / has brought difficulties?
- I really struggled this week with a lot of hard to notice/find bugs to do with bitwise operators and IO. This left me with not enough time to progress the program as I would like to: more implementation and better test coverage. The core of
my program (the actual encoding) was working fine, but the classes related to IO were quite tricky and hard to debug.

## What will I do next?
- Kill bugs, improve unit test coverage
- Take first steps towards HashMap implemenation.
