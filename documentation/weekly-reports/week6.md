# Week 6

## What have I done this week?
- Implemented all my required data structures - HashMap and minHeap.
- Finished the functionality of my program. It seems to work completely as desired.

## How has the program progressed?
- The program has progressed a lot as described above. The functionality is finished, test coverage is above 70%. Data structures are implemented. I can now focus on optimization.
- As well as implementing more unit tests, I started to implement some performance tests. Compression performance tests are done (I execute them one by one using "Run focused test method", else the output may be unclear). Decompression tests are in theory implemented but they throw IOExceptions (stream closed). I didn't yet debug them.

## What have I learned this week?
- Gained confidence when implementing data structures. At first it seemed intimidating, but actually went quite well.

## What remains unclear / has brought difficulties?
- I had a few problems implementing some methods in my HashMap implemenation. For example my keySet() -style method is horrible, and need optimising. Luckily my program only calls it once per execution.

## What will I do next?
- Documentation
- Optimisation
