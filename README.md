## Huffman coding implementation - aineopintojen harjoitusty√∂: Tietorakenteet ja algoritmit



A Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression. The process of finding and/or using such a code proceeds by means of Huffman coding.

## Usage

Clean & build, then run. Basic GUI where you can specify a file to compress or decompress. Only _absolute_ file paths are accepted. The program outputs in the following way: compressed binary gets `.huff` file extension. Decompressed files get  `originalFileName_decomp.txt`.

## Status
- To inspect the compressed binary, use `hexdump inputFileName.huff`
- To compare the input file and decoded binary, use `cmp -b inputFileName decoded_binary.txt`
 - No output indicates that the files are identical. To test, modify the files, so that one is different, and then re-execute the command.
 - Use `ls -al` to inspect the sizes of the files.

## Known issues
- Fails to write new line at EOF when decompressing.
